#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test_tokenrouter_lane.sh — the TokenRouter gateway lane must be wired into every provider list,
# expose a delegate that streams from the gateway's /v1/chat/completions with the key out of the ps
# table, pass -m through VERBATIM, fail fast on a missing key, and dispatch correctly through the
# router seam (the dead-on-dispatch defect that bit the Cline lane must not recur here).
#
# TokenRouter (https://www.tokenrouter.com) is an OpenAI-compatible model gateway. The lane is a CLOUD
# lane (the prompt leaves the machine), so it flows through the same _cloud_disclose choke point +
# secret-scan as every other cloud lane. -m is REQUIRED and passes through verbatim to the gateway's
# own catalog (their models, not a hardcoded list, and NO hardcoded default model).
#
# COST HONESTY (locked by this test): the roster and pricing are TokenRouter's and change; some
# models are a $0 promo RIGHT NOW. The lane must NEVER claim "$0 cash" or "free" as a static fact —
# cost is confirmed at RUNTIME by billing/quota errors (402/429), never by a hardcoded date.
#
# This test has TWO layers:
#   1. STATIC checks (grep-based): fast verification that wiring, key handling, and honesty guards exist.
#   2. BEHAVIORAL checks (dispatch against a fake local gateway): actually invoke delegate_tokenrouter
#      with OSRC_TOKENROUTER_URL pointed at a stub server and assert the request it received matches
#      the contract (model verbatim, Bearer auth, streaming parse). This catches regressions a static
#      grep cannot (e.g. a renamed endpoint or a key leaked into process args).
