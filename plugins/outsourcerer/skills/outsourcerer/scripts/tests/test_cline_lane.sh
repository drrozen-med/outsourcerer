# test_cline_lane.sh — the Cline engine lane must be wired into every provider list, expose a
# delegate that sends flags the CLI actually accepts, map effort to cline's --thinking knob,
# version-gate the --plan read-only guarantee, and dispatch correctly through a behavioral test.
#
# Cline (https://github.com/cline/cline) is an engine lane like droid/cursor/hermes/warp:
# -m passes through VERBATIM (cline owns its provider/model catalog); billing is the user's ClinePass
# subscription or their own keys in ~/.cline (roster + pricing are cline's). Posture is binary (--plan = read-only,
# act mode = --auto-approve true); there is no OS sandbox and no graded approval rung.
#
# This test has TWO layers:
#   1. STATIC checks (grep-based): fast verification that flags, provider lists, and wiring exist.
#   2. BEHAVIORAL checks (dispatch via fake-bin/cline): actually invoke delegate_cline with a fake
#      cline stub on PATH and assert the flags it received match the tier's contract. This catches
#      regressions a static grep cannot (e.g. a flag renamed in the dispatch line but not in a comment).
